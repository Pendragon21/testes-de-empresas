## LeetCode Challenges Repository

This repository serves as a personal collection of solutions to LeetCode coding challenges. Its purpose is to facilitate my own development and provide a guide for anyone seeking to conquer these challenges themselves.

**Motivation:**

Working through LeetCode challenges is a proven way to improve your programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and algorithmic thinking. By tackling these challenges and documenting my solutions, I aim to:

- Deepen my understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
- Explore various data structures and algorithms.
- Develop effective problem-solving strategies.
- Track my progress and identify areas for improvement.
- Share my solutions and insights to help others.

**Challenges Covered:**

This repository will gradually incorporate solutions for various LeetCode problems, encompassing different difficulty levels and topics. Some of the areas currently under focus include:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Tables
- Dynamic Programming
- Search and Sort Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Bit Manipulation

**Solution Format:**

Each challenge's solution will be documented with the following format:

- **Challenge Title and Link:** A clear reference to the specific LeetCode problem.
- **Problem Description:** A concise summary of the problem statement.
- **Solution Approach:** A detailed explanation of the chosen approach, including data structures and algorithms employed.
- **Code Implementation:** The complete code solution in Python, with comments explaining key steps and logic.
- **Time and Space Complexity Analysis:** An evaluation of the solution's computational efficiency.
- **Additional Notes:** Any further insights, alternative solutions, or optimization techniques.

**Contribution:**
