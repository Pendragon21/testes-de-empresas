## LeetCode Challenge 13: Roman to Integer

This repository contains a Python solution for LeetCode Challenge 13: Roman to Integer.

**Challenge Description:**

Given a Roman numeral string, convert it to its corresponding integer value. Roman numerals are represented by seven symbols:

- I - 1
- V - 5
- X - 10
- L - 50
- C - 100
- D - 500
- M - 1000

**Solution Approach:**

This solution implements the following steps:

1. **Define a dictionary:** A dictionary maps Roman symbols to their corresponding integer values.
2. **Iterate through the string:** Loop through each character in the Roman numeral string.
3. **Extract current value:** Obtain the integer value of the current character using the dictionary.
4. **Handle special cases:** Check if a smaller symbol precedes a larger one. If so, subtract twice the previous symbol's value to account for subtraction.
5. **Accumulate value:** Add the current symbol's value to a running total.
6. **Return final value:** After iterating through all characters, return the accumulated integer value.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the Roman numeral string.

**Space Complexity:** O(1), as the dictionary has a constant size.

**Additional Notes:**

- This solution assumes the provided Roman numeral string is valid.
- The solution can be further optimized by exploiting specific patterns in Roman numerals for faster processing.
