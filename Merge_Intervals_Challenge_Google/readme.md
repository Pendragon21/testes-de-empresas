## LeetCode Challenge 56: Merge Intervals (Readme)

This repository provides solutions for LeetCode Challenge 56: Merge Intervals. The challenge aims to merge overlapping intervals and return a list of non-overlapping intervals.

**Solution Approaches:**

- **Basic solution:** This approach utilizes sorting and iterative merging of overlapping intervals based on their starting points.
- **Optimized solution:** This enhanced version implements Timsort for efficient sorting, in-place sorting for memory optimization, and exploits specific patterns to avoid unnecessary comparisons, leading to improved runtime performance.

**Time Complexity:**

- Basic: O(n \* log n)
- Optimized: O(n \* log n) (potentially faster)

**Space Complexity:**

- Basic: O(n)
- Optimized: O(n)

**Further Enhancements:**

- Explore alternative merging strategies like sweep-line algorithms.
- Utilize efficient data structures like segment trees for larger datasets.
